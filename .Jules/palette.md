## 2026-01-23 - Replaced Dropdown with Buttons for Binary Choice
**Learning:** For simple binary choices (like picking 1 of 2 teams), buttons are significantly faster and more accessible than dropdowns. They reduce clicks (1 vs 2) and provide immediate visual confirmation via color state.
**Action:** Identify other binary or small-set choices in the UI (e.g., "Confirm/Cancel") and convert them from selects to buttons for better efficiency.
