## 2026-01-24 - Turning Dead Ends into Information
**Learning:** When a user hits an "empty state" (e.g., no matches to pick), a simple error message feels like a dead end. Providing context ("Next match in 5 days") and an alternative action ("Check leaderboard") transforms a negative experience into a helpful one.
**Action:** Always check if we can provide "what's next" or "what else" when a primary list is empty.

## 2026-02-06 - Visual Feedback for Stale States
**Learning:** In asynchronous interfaces like Discord, messages can become "stale" (e.g., a match starts while the pick menu is open). Relying on error messages after interaction ("Cannot pick: Match started") is frustrating. Proactively disabling UI elements and adding visual indicators (🔒 emoji) prevents the error loop entirely.
**Action:** When rendering interactive views that depend on time or state, always check the current state and render "disabled/locked" views if the window has passed, rather than just validating on submit.
