# Contributing to Esports-Pickem-Discord-Bot

Thanks for your interest in contributing! Please read the guidelines below to make collaboration smooth.

## Code of Conduct
Be respectful and professional. Treat others as you would want to be treated. If you'd like a formal Code of Conduct added, say so and I can add a standard one.

## How to Report Bugs
1. Check existing issues to see if the bug was already reported.
2. If not, open a new issue with:
   - A clear title
   - Steps to reproduce
   - Expected vs actual behavior
   - Relevant logs or error messages
   - Environment details (OS, Node/Python version, bot version, etc.)

## Feature Requests
Open a new issue with a description of the desired feature, why it's useful, and any implementation ideas or UI/UX considerations.

## Development Setup
1. Fork the repo and clone your fork.
2. Install dependencies:
   - `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Configure any required environment variables (e.g., Discord bot token) in a `.env` file. Do NOT commit secrets.

## Coding Style
- Follow existing project conventions.
- Keep changes focused and small; one logical change per pull request.
- Add or update tests where applicable.

## Branches and Pull Requests
1. Create a feature branch from `main`:
   - `git checkout -b feature/short-description`
2. Commit with clear messages:
   - Use present-tense, short subject line and optional body.
3. Push your branch and open a PR against the repository's `main` branch.
4. Link any related issue in the PR description.
5. Wait for CI and reviews. Address review comments and push updates to the same branch.

## Tests
Run existing tests (if any) and add tests for new functionality.

## License
By contributing, you agree that your contributions will be licensed under the repository's license (see LICENSE).

## Questions
If you're unsure about something, open an issue or ping the maintainers in the repo.

Thanks again â€” contributions are very welcome!
